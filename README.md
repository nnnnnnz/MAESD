# MAESD:A Unified Multi-Agent Evolutionary Framework for Protein Sequence Design

![figure1](./picture/figure%201.png) 

## Setup
- Install dependencies
    ```
    conda create -n maesd python=3.9
    conda activate maesd
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  Protein design model deployment
  ProteinMPNN
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/dauparas/ProteinMPNN
    ```
  Progen2
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/salesforce/progen
  cd progen/progen2
  ```
  AlphaFold2
  ```
  docker pull alphafolddev/alphafold:latest
  ```
- Set up OpenAI API configs in `config.yaml`.

## Datasets
All datasets can be found in the `data/` folder.

**Task1.Semantic-to-Biological Translation Test
We randomly selected 1,000 reviewed protein entries from the UniProt KB database as the test set.

**Task2.Domain-Guided Test
We randomly selected 1,000 entries from the Pfam-A seed dataset as the test setã€‚

**Task3.Structure-Guided Test
We randomly selected 400 protein structures with lengths under 500 amino acids from the PDB database as the test set.

### Installation

```bash
cd MAESD
python setup.py install
```
